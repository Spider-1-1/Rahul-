I am a big fan of Japanese culture like how they respect others by bowing slightly towards them to greet or  to show respect and that is the reason for my website pic where you can see the glimpse of Japan's beauty.
Cherry blossoms bloom in Japan from late March to early April, but the blooming period can last up to four months due to the country's large size and diverse geography.Cherry Blossom are flowers which is also known by the name of "Sakura flowers".</p>
